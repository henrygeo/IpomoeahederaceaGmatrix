# IpomoeahederaceaGmatrix
Data and additional materials for G matrices of Ipomoea hederacea

G matrices were generated using the code and data included here, but for ease of access the G matrices used for downstream analyses are also included. The G matrices used as null models are also included here, to construct those on your own will likely take a long time (days to weeks).

Many parts of the code are adapted from: Aguirre et al. 2014 and Puentes et al. 2016, as described in our associated paper: G matrix stability of clinally varying populations of an annual weed.
